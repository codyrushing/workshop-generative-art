`canvas-sketch` is Matt DesLauriers' tool for quickly scaffolding a canvas drawing project.  It handles things like scaling, rebuilding on change, and even cool settings like using physical units (cm, in), and changing canvas dimensions and dpi for print.

`canvas-sketch-cli` is the CLI, obviously.  It will even handle installing all of the drawing dependencies - it's pretty slick.
